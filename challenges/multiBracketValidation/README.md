### Queue Challenge:
* Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
* Define a method called enqueue which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue.
* Define a method called dequeue that does not take any argument, removes the node from the ftront of the queue, and returns the nodeâ€™s value.
* Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located in the front of the queue, without removing it from the queue.
