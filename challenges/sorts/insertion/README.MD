## Challenge: Implement insertion sort

###  Description
* Make the psuedo code work and then document appropriately

### Approach & Efficiency
* I first tried to understand the problem domain and the described solution and then I wrote it out in a way that made sense to me. (which is why I think my code looks quite a bit different from the psuedocode)

### Solution
* No "solution" for this one, its to implement a thing that already works
