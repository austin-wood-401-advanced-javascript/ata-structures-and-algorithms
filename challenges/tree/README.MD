### Stacks Challenge:

### Tree Challenge:
* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
* Create a Binary Tree class that defines a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

## Binary Tree Class
#  Create a BinarySearchTree class that:
* Defines a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
* Defines a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
