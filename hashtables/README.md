## Hashtables
### DSA Hash Tables
#### Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:

* add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed. 
* hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.
* get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table. 
* contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already. 

#### Approach & Efficiency
* O1 or On depending on if there is a colision.

#### API
* .add() 
* .get() 
* .contains() 
* .hash()
