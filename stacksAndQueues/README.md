### Stacks Challenge:
* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.
* Create a Stack class that creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
* Define a method called push which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack.
* Define a method called pop that does not take any argument, removes the node from the top of the stack, and returns the node’s value.
* Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located on top of the stack, without removing it from the stack.
### Queue Challenge 
* Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
* Define a method called enqueue which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue.
* Define a method called dequeue that does not take any argument, removes the node from the ftront of the queue, and returns the node’s value.
* Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located in the front of the queue, without removing it from the queue.
